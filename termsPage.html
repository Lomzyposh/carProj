        <p>
          <b>3. Content</b><br>

        </p>
        <p><b>4. Third party content, sites, and services</b><br>
          Our site and Content available through the Service may contain features and functionalities that may link you
          or provide you with access to third party content (e.g. other websites) which is completely independent of

          Your interactions with physical or legal persons that you have met through the Service, including payment and
          delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with
          such dealings, are solely between you and such physical or legal persons. You should make whatever
          investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with

          persons.

          You agree that PoshAuto shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind whatsoever

          event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby explicitly and irrevocably release

          Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>5. Suspected Infringement</b><br>
          If you for whatever reason believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
          infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please notify PoshAutos
          customer service.

          In such case, please provide our customer service with sufficient detail in order for PoshAuto to be able to

        </p>

        <p>
          <b>6. User Content</b><br>
          YOU OWN ALL OF YOUR USER CONTENT, INCLUDING ANY PHOTOS THAT YOU UPLOAD TO THE SITE.

          At a High Level. The Service lets you upload and post your Photos, as well as written text, images, web links,
          location information, and other content (“User Content”). Any User Content that you make available on the
          Service will belong to you or your licensors. We will not claim any ownership in your User Content–it is
          completely, 100%, yours.

          Limited License to Us. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to
          sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, adapt, perform, reproduce, modify, translate, and distribute
          your User Content (in whole or in part) in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or
          hereafter developed). You understand that we will not pay you for any use of your Photos and that your Photos
          will be made available to the public for their use without providing you attribution or compensation.

          Authority. When you upload Photos to the Service, in addition to the license that you grant us to post the
          Photos publicly and permit other users to download and use them, you also authorize us under your copyrights
          to enforce any violations of the sublicenses we grant in the Photos to others. In other words, if an user
          misuses one of your Photos downloaded from the Service, you authorize us to enforce your copyrights in the
          Photos on your behalf. If you are interested in learning more about this, please see our FAQs.

          Representations and Warranties. You are solely responsible for your User Content and any consequences that
          occur because you’ve uploaded or posted the User Content on the Service. Each time you upload or post publish
          User Content, you represent and warrant to us that:

          You are the creator and owner of the User Content or have all necessary rights from other people or companies
          to use, and permit other users to use, your User Content on the Service as envisioned in this Section 6;
          andYour User Content (including as used by you, us, or other users of the Service) does not and will not
          infringe or misappropriate any third party right, including copyright and other intellectual property rights,
          privacy rights, rights of publicity, or moral rights, or slander, defame, or libel anyone. In other words,
          your User Content must be your original work and you must have the permission of any third parties that have
          rights in the User Content before you upload or post the User Content to the Service.

          Disclaimer. There is no reasonable way for us to monitor all of the User Content that gets uploaded to or
          posted on the Service, and we are under no obligation to you or the other users to monitor, edit, or control
          the User Content that you and other users upload or post to the Service. This means that we are not
          responsible for any User Content on the Service and you agree not to make any claims against us on account of
          User Content. That said, we may at any time remove, edit, screen, or block any User Content from the Service
          (without notifying you first) for any reason, including if we think the User Content violates these Terms or
          is otherwise objectionable. When you use the Service, you will be exposed to the User Content of other users,
          some of which may be offensive, inaccurate, or indecent. We may investigate claims alleging that User Content
          violates these Terms and, in those cases, we alone will decide what actions to take (if any) regarding the
          User Content in question.

          The right to access, rectify and update. You have the right to access, rectify and update your personal data
          at any time by signing on to PoshAuto. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal data because it is
          very difficult to verify your identity remotely. If you wish to rectify or update personal data disclosed in a
          public posting, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to respond to your request in accordance
          with legal requirements.
          The right to data portability. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to (i) request that we send you
          a copy of your personal data you provided to us, in which case we shall provide you with those data in a
          structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or (ii) transmit those data to another controller.
          The right to be forgotten. You have right to request that we erase your data. If you wish to erase the
          personal data we hold about you, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to respond to your
          request in accordance with legal requirements. If the personal data we collect is no longer needed for any
          purposes and we are not required by law to retain it, we will do what we can to erase it.
          The right to restrict processing. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to restrict the processing
          of your personal data, for example, where the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you or if the
          personal data we collect is no longer needed for processing, but is required by you in connection with any
          legal claims.
          The right to object. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to certain types of processing,
          including processing for direct marketing and profiling.

          supervisory authority about how we process your personal data.
          The right to withdraw consent. You have the right to withdraw any consent given to the processing of your data
          (i.e., we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data), you have the right to withdraw
          your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your
          personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your consent to the processing
          of your personal data at any time by contacting us with the details provided below.
          Rights related to automated decision-making. You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based
          solely on automated processing and which produces legal or other significant effects on you. In particular,
          you have the right:
          to obtain human intervention;
          to express your point of view;
          to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after an assessment; and
          to challenge such a decision.
          You can exercise your rights by submitting a request through the "contact us" form on our Site.

          Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal data from view as soon as reasonably
          possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We may retain personal data
          from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, assist with
          any investigations, enforce our User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>10. Security</b><br>
          Your personal data is stored on our servers. We treat personal data as an asset that must be protected and
          make extensive use of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal data
          against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully
          intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal
          data that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not
          promise, and you should not expect, that your personal data or private communications will always remain
          private.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>11. Third Parties</b><br>
          Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and
          disclosure of personal data we collect from you. If you disclose your personal data to others, whether they
          are buyers or sellers on our Site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their
          use or disclosure of the personal data you disclose to them. PoshAuto does not control the privacy policies of
          third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We
          encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal data to others.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>12. General</b><br>
          We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms
          automatically take effect on the day they are posted on the Site. If your questions are not answered online,

        <h2>Buying Safely</h2>
        PoshAuto does not work as a trustee service. Even though we demand proof of ownership or certificate of
        authenticity from all private sellers, we do not certify any dealers or private sellers. Therefore, we do not
        take any responsibility for transactions between sellers and buyers.

        For your best experience buying online, here are some tips from our experienced PoshAuto team:
        <ul>
          <li>Never pay for goods in advance. Reputable dealers will request payment on delivery or use established
            escrow systems.</li>
          <li>Make sure to sign a written contract before transactions are made.</li>
          <li>Paperwork sent by electronic means can easily be falsified. Have this in mind if you ask for registration
            and identity documents by e-mail.</li>
          <li>Watch out for false emails. PoshAuto would never contact you by mail to ask you for your account details
            or password. In the unlikely event of receiving email from PoshAuto asking you about your details, please <a
              href="">contact us</a></li>
        </ul>
        Do not forget to...
        Ask for original registration papers, proof of ownership or certificate of authenticity.
        Always sign a written contract.
        Check what import/export taxes apply from/to your country.

          So, as you can see, PoshAuto is working for us.

          Although we are one of the sole Eurocopter agents in Sweden and Finland we also offer services to our clients
          to locate the best helicopters on the market or to bring their aircraft to the notice of potential buyers,
          which is where PoshAuto is of great help. Our focus on Eurocopter certainly positions us at the luxury end of
          the market, which fits perfectly with PoshAuto.

          We have been known around the world for our aircraft and services and PoshAuto has helped us increase our
          brand recognition and cement our relationship with existing clients. Thank you PoshAuto
          <br><br>

        <p class="diffe">
          We have been a part of PoshAuto since the beginning but only since we really started to give attention to our
          listings and making sure that our ads were up to date and good looking, this beautiful website started to give
          us good results and sales.

        <p class="diffe">
          PoshAuto has quickly become a must-have in the world of high-end watches. In less than 6 months we've sold a
          number of cars to new clients all over the world via PoshAuto. The combination of a great-looking website,
          focus on high-end products and great customer service is unbeatable
